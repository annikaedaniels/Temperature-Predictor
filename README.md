# Temperature-Predictor
This project is a machine learning project to analyze average temperature in cities and then predict future temperatures. The models chosen were Linear, K Nearest Neighbors, KNN with GridSearchCV, and Random Forest.
Grid SearchCV was only used to hyper-parameter tune K Nearest Neighbors; however, it can be used for Random Forest given enough training time.

The data was taken from the following kaggle repository:
